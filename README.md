# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing key health indicators and their correlation with heart disease

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This interactive Tableau dashboard explores the relationships between various health indicators and the likelihood of heart disease. It enables users to filter and analyze patient data based on demographic and clinical variables such as gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

ðŸ”— **Live Dashboard**: [View on Tableau Public]([https://public.tableau.com/views/HeartDiseaseAnalysis_17501757110380/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link])

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze key clinical indicators and their relationship to heart disease.
- Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- Provide an accessible, data-driven tool for understanding risk factors.
- Demonstrate interactive data exploration using Tableau.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- **Tableau Public** â€“ for dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Heart Disease Dataset** â€“ sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)** â€“ for initial data cleaning and formatting

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Interactive filters and charts for gender, age, chest pain, and more.
- Exploratory data analysis in Jupyter Notebook.
- Feature selection and model training (logistic regression, etc.).
- Performance evaluation and interpretability.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Insights
- Categorical Features
  - **Chest Pain Type:** Type 4 chest pain is strongly linked to heart disease, while Types 1â€“3 are more common in healthy individuals.
  - **Slope of ST Segment:** Upsloping ST segments often indicate no heart disease; flat or downsloping types are more frequent in diagnosed patients.
  - **Sex:** Males show a higher rate of heart disease in the dataset compared to females.
- Numerical Features
  - **Number of Major Vessels (`ca`):** A higher number of affected vessels is associated with heart disease, while most healthy individuals have none.
  - **Serum Cholesterol (`chol`):** Cholesterol levels are slightly higher in heart disease cases but show considerable overlap between classes.
